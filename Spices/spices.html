    <h4>Black Pepper</h4><br>
    <p>Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, 
      cultivated for its fruit (the peppercorn), which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.
      The fruit is a drupe (stonefruit) which is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter (fresh and fully mature),
       dark red, and contains a stone which encloses a single pepper seed. Peppercorns and 
       the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper 
       (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).
